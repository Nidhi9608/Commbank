# Tweets Analysis 
* **Project Title:** Tweets Analysis
* **Database:** twitter_db

## Project Overview  
Due to shortage of information on official website I got some sample data and created a database twitter_db. This project will demonstrate engagement of the tweets on their twitter account by solving queries using the sample data and visually representing using Excel dashboard. The goal is to showcase skills in data analysis, data documentation, unstructured data and data visualization.

## Objectives
  1. Database Design: Create a database using 50 sample data. 
  2. CRUD operations: Extraction, combination and manipulation of data.
  3. Data Visualization and distribution: Representation of data through charts and graphs.

## **1. Database Designing**     
```sql
-- create table tweets
create table tweets (
    tweet_id bigint primary key,
    tweet_text text,
    created_at datetime,
    author_id bigint,
    retweets int,
    likes int,
    views int,
    sentiment varchar(15)
);

INSERT INTO tweets (tweet_id, tweet_text, created_at, author_id, retweets, likes, views, sentiment)
